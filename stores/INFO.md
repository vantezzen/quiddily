Quiddily replaces words on websites with more advances synonyms to help you learn new words.

Learning new words is hard. Quiddily helps you learn more advanced synonyms by replacing words on websites you browse with their synonyms.
This way, you'll learn new words in context and without needing to put more effort into learning new vocabulary!

In Quiddily's settings you can change how frequently words should be replaced with synonyms and disable Quiddily completely for pages that have problems with the replaced words.
